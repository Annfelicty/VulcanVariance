#  Vulcan Variance Project Repository

Welcome to the official repository for **VULCAN VARIANCE**, a multi-source movie data analysis and visualization project.

---

##  What We've Been Working On

This project brings together data from IMDB, TMDB, Box Office Mojo, and The Numbers to create a unified, cleaned, and analysis-ready movie dataset. We used it to explore trends in genre performance, budget vs revenue patterns, rating comparisons, and ultimately to build a dashboard that empowers **data-driven decisions** in the film industry.

Whether you're an investor, studio exec, or data enthusiast, this project helps you ask:  
> *"What makes a movie successful?"*

##  Main Files
- there are two there is the data cleaning file where its the original cleaning, then the movie analysis file where its the final product

>  **`Movie_Analysis.ipynb` and `Notebook_Data_Cleaning.ipynb`**  
This is the **main Jupyter Notebook** that contains:
- All data cleaning and merging logic
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations (Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Pre-processing for dashboard export
- Comments and markdowns guiding you through the project like a story
